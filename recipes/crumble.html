    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A crumble is a traditional British dessert consisting of a fruit filling topped with a crumbly mixture of butter, flour, and sugar. It is typically baked until the topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling. Crumbles are often served with custard, cream, or ice cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of fruit (such as apples, berries, or rhubarb)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and diced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the fruit by washing, peeling (if necessary), and cutting it into bite-sized pieces. Place the fruit in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and cinnamon (if using).</li>
        <li>Add the cold, diced butter to the flour mixture. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>>Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the fruit in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling.</li>
